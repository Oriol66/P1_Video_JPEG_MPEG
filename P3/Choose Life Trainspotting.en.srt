1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,340
Nostalgia, that's why you're here

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,680
your tourist in your own youth

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,940
Just cuz you had a near-death experience. Now, you're feeling all fuzzy and warm

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
What other moments we'll be revisiting?

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,020
Here's a good one, how about the time you sold Tommy his very first hit?

6
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,760
Leading him onto heroin addiction HIV infection and ultimately his death

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,860
Aye that's mine, how's yours?

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,040
She'd be a woman by now

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,440
Maybe kids of her own. But she never got that far did she?

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,980
Never got to lead her life

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,120
Because her father, someone who should have been looking after her

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,240
Protecting his own infant was too busy filling his own veins with heroin

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,920
To check that she was breathing properly

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,000
choose life

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,640
We're going for a walk.

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,760
What?

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,160
A walk

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,280
oh Fuck

19
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,060
Choose life, choose a job, choose a career, choose a family, choose a fucking big television

20
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,560
choose washing machines, cars, Compact Disc players, and electrical tin openers

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,740
Choose group health low cholesterol and dental insurance

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,479
Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments, choose a starter home choose your friends

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,240
Choose your future choose life
